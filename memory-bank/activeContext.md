[2025-12-29 19:10:20] - Current project status: library_scanner_domain is a complete domain layer for a library scanner app, implementing clean architecture with fpdart for functional programming, Sembast for local storage, and comprehensive test coverage. All code has been analyzed, formatted, and verified for best practices. No active development tasks currently.

[2026-01-15 19:28:48] - 2026-01-15 - Comprehensive code tidy performed on the library_scanner_domain codebase. Fixed several errors including missing exports, incorrect throw types, and unused parameters. Remaining issues in import_library_usecase.dart (logger undefined, incomplete code) and tag_repository_impl.dart (unused databaseService parameter). Codebase formatted, analyzed for style violations, and verified for clean architecture and fpdart usage. Some tests passing, LF line endings ensured, unused imports removed where possible.
